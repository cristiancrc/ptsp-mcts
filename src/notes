TODO:
- set eclipse on hp to read dict in dropbox
- for a* is it run each time or do we just query a matrix?
- use evaluators with weight zero for fuel and damage, for comparison purposes
- implement panic mode as paper
- macroing is used but the child is not used
- check the random / sequential node selection in tree policy / default policy
- panic mode exact parameters are in nsga2 paper
